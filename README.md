# Library-JS-Project
Odin Project Assignment to practice object manipulation

Basic display to show books input by the user via the form at the bottom of the page.
Books are stored in an array and appended to the table each time one is added.
Button for each row to remove that book from the table
The "Read" column that displays whether the book has been read can be toggled between "Yes" and "No" for each individual book by clicking on it.

To-Do:
-Have button remove book from "library" array
-Clean up "Read" column to make toggle usage more obvious/intuitive (checkbox?)
-Add local storage usage to save library data between visits
